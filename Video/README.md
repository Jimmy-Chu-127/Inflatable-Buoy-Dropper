## Software:
Davinci Resolve 18

## Ideas
 1. An advert
 2. A video about the problem, solution, roadblock and then the test
    * We should take videos throughout the design process - start early

__IMP:__ 
1. Need to have demo/ deliverable inside of video
2. Need to have voiceovers
3. Find non-copyright music
   
### To Do: 
* Prepare Camera etc for filming in makerspace/ while we are working
* Settle on the format of video - what direction we want
* Decide who is going to edit the video
*
