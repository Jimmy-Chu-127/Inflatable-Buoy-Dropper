# VIDEO OUTLINE/ IDEAS

## Software:
Davinci Resolve 18

## Ideas
 1. An advert
 2. A video about the problem, solution, roadblock and then the test
    * We should take videos throughout the design process - start early

__IMP:__ 
1. Need to have demo/ deliverable inside of video
2. Need to have voiceovers
3. Find non-copyright music
   
### To Do: 
* Prepare Camera etc for filming in makerspace/ while we are working
* Settle on the format of video - what direction we want
* Decide who is going to edit the video

### Video Outline:
1. Intro - Team name, members - animate this
2. Project Demo - with voiceover - like an advert 
   * Shot of ocean with someone struggling to swim
   * Drone takes off with out attachment
   * Person floats on buoy
4. Cuts of us working on the parts - mashed together - emphasize on one or two bits
5. Outro - with music, credits and links to our project
